#Switch Database:

#Collection is like table in sql db

#2 ways to create collection.
i) db.createCollection("collectionName")
ii) db.collectionName.insertOne(Object)
- collection will automatically be created during insert process. Empty collections are actually not created in mongodb.

=========INSERT=========
#2 ways to insert a document in mongodb:
i) insertOne(Object) // inserts single object
ii) insertMany([arry of objects]) // inserts array of objects



======FIND=============
#2 ways to find data:
i) find() // accepts a query object, if left empty, all documents will be returned.
ii)findOne() //returns only one result.
* parameter: to query specific Data, use query parameter inside find({key:value}) or findOne({key:value}) .
* Projection: Both find methods accept a second parameter(optional) called projection. It is an object that describes which fields to include in the results.
              If this field omitted, all fields will be included in the results.
	      eg: db.posts.find({valueToFind..},{projectionKey:1 or 0,..}) // all the projectionKeys must be either 0 or 1, if 0, only these field will be excluded and for 1, only these fields will be included.
              exception: can use 0 for _id field (auto generated) and 1 with other values. eg: db.posts.find({},{_id:0,title:1,date:1})


========= UPDATE =========
#2 ways to update data:
i)updateOne({keyValueToSelectSpecificObject},{$specialKeyword:{newKeyValueToUpdate}) //updates only one (first matched result) document.
ii)updateMany(...same as above) // will update all documents that match the provided query.
*Special keyword like: $set (to set value), $inc (increment)
*)upsert // If you would like to insert the document if it is not found, you can use the upsert option.



========== DELETE ==============
i)deleteOne() //deletes first matched object
ii) deleteMany() //deletes all the matched object


============ ARRAY ==================
i)$addToSet: add distinct(পৃথক/স্পষ্ট)  elements to an array.




============ Aggregation ===================
#Definition from ChatGPT:
Imagine you have a bunch of documents in a collection, each representing a person with their name, age, and city. 
Aggregation allows you to answer questions like:
    What is the average age of all the people in the collection?
    How many people live in each city?
    What are the most common names among all the people?
    What is the total age of all people from a specific city?
For example, to find the average age of all people, you would use the following aggregation stages:

    $group: This stage groups the documents together, treating them as a single entity.
    $project: This stage allows you to shape the output by specifying the fields you want to include or exclude.
    $avg: This stage calculates the average age based on the grouped documents.

By combining these stages, you can manipulate and transform your data in a flexible and efficient way



-------------------NOTES-----------------------------
* If you try to insert documents into a collection that does not exist, MongoDB will create the collection automatically.
